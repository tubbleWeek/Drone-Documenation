# Phasespace System

This documentation is for the phasespace system located in Shepherd Labs at the UMN.

## Getting Started

I will have assumed that you have downloaded the Phasesspace master client

To run the master client in Ubuntu you must install it using wine

To install and run:

```
wine msiexec /i whatever-filename.msi 
wine start whatever-filename.msi
```
